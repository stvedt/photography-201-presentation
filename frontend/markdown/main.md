## Looking vs. Seeing

Brain interprets most of our environment and is subjective

Camera is objective

Even looking through the viewfind more might be in frame than your brain is focusing on.

--

### Lenses

--

### Pinhole Camera

--

### Single-Lens Reflex (SLR)

---

## Composition

- Bound by a Frame
- Arrangement of forms and tones
- Pleasing to the viewer
- Guides the viewers eye to the subject

--

### Subject/Background

- Clearly defined subject and background
- There should be no question what the photos subject is.

--

### Balance
 
 - graphically weight
 - metaphorical signifigance
 - negative space
 - feel

--

### Point of View

- Height
- Angle
- Take boring subject matter and make it interesting
- Emotional (looking up implies power down opposite)

- Shoot from the hip/ Live view

--

### Simplicity

- reduce number of things in your image
- helps define subject (more obvious where the viewer should look)
- painters add things to a canvas / photographers remove elements from the frame
- closer is almost always better/simpler

---

### Finding good photos/subject matter

- Don't need a special location/event
- More on the photographer than the subject/location

--

## Work the shot

- It takes a lot of bad photos to make a good one.
- Trust your insticts and follow it.
- Look for/find the shot.
- Move your feet/pov

--

## Practice
 

---

## Geometry



--

### Shutter Speed

The shutter controls how long the film/digital sensor is exposed to light.

- Flap on pinhole camera
- Curtains on an SLR
- Full stops: 1/500s, 1/250s, etc.

--

### Aperture

The Aperture controls how much light passes through the lens.

- Adjustable in the lens
- Size of the hole which light travels through.
- Measure in F-stops
- Full stops: f/2.8, f/5, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, f/16, f22

--

--

### Sensor/Film Sensitivity


Different mediums have varying sensitivity to light (Measured with ISO & Film Speed).

- Higher sensitivy = more light
- Risk of noise/grain

---

## In Practice

--

### Through the Viewfinder

- Exposure Settings
- Light Meter
- Focus Points
- Aperture is always wide open. (Depth of Field Preview Button)

![""](images/viewfinder-final.jpg)

--

### Pressing the Shutter Button

- Half Press = Light Meter & Focus
- Full Press = Take Image

--

### Metering

Using the camera to read the amount of light.

- Evaluative
- Spot

--

### Focusing

- Aperture dertermines Depth of Field (DoF)
- Person decides where to focus the camera

--

### Manual Mode

Set all exposure settings manually.

--

### Priority Modes

Set one point in exposure triangle.

- Shutter Speed
- Aperture
- Exposure Compensation

--

### Exposure Compensation

Increase or decrease the exposure from light meter.

---

## Creative Considerations

- Exposure Triangle for Creative Effect
- Subject/Background
- Composition

--

### Wide Aperture (low f-stop)

- Shallow depth of field

--

### Narrow Aperture (high f-stop)

- Wide depth of field

![""](images/large-dof.jpg)

--

### Bokeh

--

### Fast Shutter Speed

### Slow Shutter Speed

--

### Wide-Angle

## Workflow

How to manage and edit images.

--

## File Formats

RAW vs. JPG

- Quality vs. Filesize
- Many raw file formats, including  K25, KDC, CR2, ERF, MEF, MOS, NEF, ORF, PEF, RW2 and the list goes on.

--

### DNG

Adobe's solution to RAW files. Widely seen as the standard RAW format. Conversion from camera specific to DNG possible through Lightroom, Bridge, etc.

--

### Software

- Adobe Lightroom
- ImageCapture
- Bridge
- Finder/Explorer

---

## What Camera Should I Use?

"The best camera is the camera you have with you."

DSLR = Highest Quality, Maximum Control & Flexibility

Point & Shoot = Control & Convenience

Phone = Convenience

--

### iPhone/SmartPhones

The key the ability to take control.

Control/lock focus and exposure.

--

### Noteworthy Apps

- Camera+
- SnapSeed
- VSCOcam
- Afterlight
- SlowShutter
- iOS9 (Manual Controls)
- Lenstag
- EyeFi

## Practice
___

### Take some photos

### Ask Questions!

- Use manual mode to create a good exposure
- Use a priority mode for creative effect
