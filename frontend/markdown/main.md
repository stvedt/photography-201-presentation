## Balance of Technical and Creative Decisions

Technical Understanding needed to control creative decisions

---

## Lenses

- Zoom
- Prime

--

### Field of View

Measured in Focal Length

- Normal
- Wide
- Telephoto

--

### Image Sensor Size

- 35MM Film Size = Full Frame Digital
- Cropped Sensor
- Smaller Sensor Wider Depth of Field (more in focus)
- Full Frame Shallower

![""](images/crop-factor-sensor-size.jpg)

--

### Normal

- 35mm on Full-Frame

--

### Wide

- Distortion at edges
- Fisheye
- Rectilinear Correction

--

### Wide Distortion

![""](images/wide-distortion.jpg)

--

### Telephoto

- Introduces Handheld shake,
- Faster Shutter Speed
- Compresses depth.
- Flattering for facial features.

--

### Wide Depth

### Wide

--

### Telephoto

--

### Stabilization

- Optical Stabilization (Uses Battery)
- Digital Sucks

--

## Aperture

- Blurring
- Sharpness

--

### Speed 

Apeture referred to as speed

- faster shutter speed due to letting more light in.
- f/1.8 wide opening more blurring
- High aperture f/22 can introduce softening/defractions

--

### Bokeh

![""](images/bokeh.jpg)

--

### Sharp Detail

- Fast lenses provide great sharpness. f/2.8

![""](images/sharp-fast.jpg)

--

### Blur

f/1.8 from a distance

### Blur

f/1.8 from a distance

--

## Dynamic Range

Level of details across highlights and shadows

- Low Range: If highlights have details then shadows are black.
- High Range: shadows and highlights both have details.

--

### Low Dynamic Range

### Low Dynamic Range

--

### Bad High Dynamic Range (HDR)

--

### High Dynamic Range

---

## Composition

- Bound by a Frame
- Arrangement of forms and tones
- Pleasing to the viewer
- Guides the viewers eye to the subject

--

### Subject/Background

- Clearly defined subject and background
- There should be no question what the photos subject is.

--

![""](images/jarvis-subject.png)

--

### Balance
 
 - graphically weight
 - metaphorical signifigance
 - negative space
 - feel
 - direction, entry, exit

--

--

--

### Ratios for Balance

- Rule of thirds
- Golden Ratios

--

### Rulte of Thirds

### Golden Triangles

### Entry/Exit

--

![""](images/jarvis-entry-2.png)

--

![""](images/jarvis-entry-3.png)

--

### Point of View

- Height
- Angle
- Take boring subject matter and make it interesting
- Emotional (looking up implies power down opposite)
- Shoot from the hip/ Live view


--

### High Angle

![""](images/perspective-high.jpg)

--

### Low Angle

![""](images/perspective-low.jpg)

--

### Top Down

![""](images/top-down.jpg)

--

### Simplicity

- reduce number of things in your image
- helps define subject (more obvious where the viewer should look)
- painters add things to a canvas / photographers remove elements from the frame
- closer is almost always better/simpler

--

### Simple

![""](images/simple.jpg)

## Geometry

- Lines
- Shapes
- Repetition
- Rule of Threes
- Symmetry
- Intersections

--

### Lines

- Literal Implied
- Leading Lines

--

![""](images/lines.jpg)

--

![""](images/lines-2.jpg)

--

### Shapes

- Abstract objects into geometric shapes
- Use shadow and light to create shapes

--

--

### Repitition

--

![""](images/repitition.jpg)

--

### Rule of Threes

- Groups of threes are interesting

--

![""](images/ben-threes.jpg)

--

![""](images/threes-2.jpg)

--

### Symmetry

- Even balance
- Viewers Eye Know where to look
- Good for Square Crops

--

### Intersections

## Creative Effects/Decisions

--

### Fast Shutter Speed

--

### Slow Shutter Speed

--

### Framing

---

### Finding good photos/subject matter

- Don't need a special location/event
- More on the photographer than the subject/location

--

## Work the shot

- It takes a lot of bad photos to make a good one.
- Trust your insticts and follow it.
- Look for/find the shot.
- Move your feet/pov

--

## Practice

- Black and White (Tone, Line and Form)
- Have a Task at Hand (An Assignment)
- Back to basics (Geometry, Light as Subject)
- Perfect Practice Makes Perfect
- Look at work of other photographers

---

## Workflow

How to manage and edit images.

--

## File Formats

RAW vs. JPG

- More Dynamic Range
- Ability to change white balance
- Quality vs. Filesize
- Many raw file formats, including  K25, KDC, CR2, ERF, MEF, MOS, etc.

--

### Use DNG

Adobe's solution to RAW files. Widely seen as the standard RAW format. Conversion from camera specific to DNG possible through Lightroom, Bridge, etc.

--

### Software

- Adobe Lightroom
- ImageCapture
- Bridge
- Finder/Explorer

---

## What Camera Should I Use?

"The best camera is the camera you have with you."

DSLR = Highest Quality, Maximum Control & Flexibility

Point & Shoot = Control & Convenience

Phone = Convenience

--

### iPhone/SmartPhones

The key the ability to take control.

Control/lock focus and exposure.

--

### Noteworthy Apps

- Camera+
- SnapSeed
- VSCOcam
- Afterlight
- SlowShutter
- Lenstag

---

## Practice
___

### Take some photos

### Ask Questions!

- Use manual mode to create a good exposure
- Use a priority mode for creative effect
