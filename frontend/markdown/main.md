## Looking vs. Seeing

Brain interprets most of our environment and is subjective

Camera is objective

Even looking through the viewfind more might be in frame than your brain is focusing on.

---

## Lenses

![""](images/obscura.jpg)

- Zoom
- Prime

--

### Field of View

Measure in Focal Length

- Normal
- Wide
- Telephoto

--

### Image Sensor and Focal Length

- 35MM Film is the base 70 years)
- Cropped Sensor

--

### Wide

- Distortion at edges
- Fisheye
- Rectilinear


--

### Telephoto

- Introduces Handheld shake,
- Faster Shutter Speed

--

### Stabilization

- Optical Stabilization (Uses Battery)
- Digital Sucks

--

## Characteristic

- Compression of space
- Distortion


---

## Depth of Field/Aperture

- Blurring
- Sharpness

--
## Speed 

Apeture referred to as speed

- faster shutter speed due to letting more light in.

- High aperture f/22 can introduce softening/defractions

--

### Sensor Size

- Smaller Sensor Wider Depth of Field (more in focus)
- Full Frame Shallower

--

### Focal Length

Perceived Depth of Field
Zoomed in = Larger background more apparent that it's out of focus

---

## Composition

- Bound by a Frame
- Arrangement of forms and tones
- Pleasing to the viewer
- Guides the viewers eye to the subject

--

### Subject/Background

- Clearly defined subject and background
- There should be no question what the photos subject is.

--

### Balance
 
 - graphically weight
 - metaphorical signifigance
 - negative space
 - feel

--

### Point of View

- Height
- Angle
- Take boring subject matter and make it interesting
- Emotional (looking up implies power down opposite)

- Shoot from the hip/ Live view

--

### Simplicity

- reduce number of things in your image
- helps define subject (more obvious where the viewer should look)
- painters add things to a canvas / photographers remove elements from the frame
- closer is almost always better/simpler

---

### Finding good photos/subject matter

- Don't need a special location/event
- More on the photographer than the subject/location

--

## Work the shot

- It takes a lot of bad photos to make a good one.
- Trust your insticts and follow it.
- Look for/find the shot.
- Move your feet/pov

--

## Practice

- Black and White (Tone, Line and Form)
- Have a Task at Hand (An Assignment)
- Back to basics (Geometry, Light as Subject)
- Perfect Practice Makes Perfect
- Look at work of other photographers

---

## Geometry

- Lines
- Shapes
- Repetition
- Rule of Thirds
- Perspective
- Symmetry
- Focal length, position and depth
- Intersections

---

## Creative Considerations

- Exposure Triangle for Creative Effect
- Subject/Background
- Composition

--

### Wide Aperture (low f-stop)

- Shallow depth of field

![""](images/small-dof.jpg)

--

### Narrow Aperture (high f-stop)

- Wide depth of field

![""](images/large-dof.jpg)

--

### Bokeh

![""](images/bokeh.jpg)

--

### Fast Shutter Speed

--

### Slow Shutter Speed

--

### Wide-Angle

--

### Telephoto

--

### Dynamic Range

---

## Workflow

How to manage and edit images.

--

## File Formats

RAW vs. JPG

- Quality vs. Filesize
- Many raw file formats, including  K25, KDC, CR2, ERF, MEF, MOS, NEF, ORF, PEF, RW2 and the list goes on.

--

### DNG

Adobe's solution to RAW files. Widely seen as the standard RAW format. Conversion from camera specific to DNG possible through Lightroom, Bridge, etc.

--

### Software

- Adobe Lightroom
- ImageCapture
- Bridge
- Finder/Explorer

---

## What Camera Should I Use?

"The best camera is the camera you have with you."

DSLR = Highest Quality, Maximum Control & Flexibility

Point & Shoot = Control & Convenience

Phone = Convenience

--

### iPhone/SmartPhones

The key the ability to take control.

Control/lock focus and exposure.

--

### Noteworthy Apps

- Camera+
- SnapSeed
- VSCOcam
- Afterlight
- SlowShutter
- iOS9 (Manual Controls)
- Lenstag
- EyeFi


---

## Practice
___

### Take some photos

### Ask Questions!

- Use manual mode to create a good exposure
- Use a priority mode for creative effect
